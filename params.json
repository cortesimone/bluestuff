{"name":"Bluestuff","tagline":"jesse's recipe for blue candy (with formulae), as breaking bad's meth","body":"# bluestuff\r\n\r\n![meth](https://github.com/viccuad/bluestuff/raw/master/images/meth.jpg)\r\n\r\nyo, this is a recipe for blue candy, like Breaking Bad's meth. (if you haven't seen Breaking Bad series, go and see it, bitch!)\r\n\r\nthe trick is that the recipe is made with formulae (e.g. H-(C=O)-(CHOH)5-H instead of glucose, that \"equals\" corn syrup), and the chemical process produced to get \"rock candy\", to make sugar crystalize, is roughly explained, as Jesse would do (yo, science, bitch! ^^).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was made as a birthday present for a friend, who is a chemist and also loves Breaking Bad (yes, you, Borja!).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the recipe there are some keys provided, just in case.\r\n\r\n\r\nTip: if you go to the .pdf and click on \"View raw\", it gets downloaded \r\n\r\n\r\n## references:\r\n1. http://www.thekitchn.com/pantry-staples-diy-cane-sugar-131934\r\n2. http://www.sugarhero.com/2012/07/blue-crystal-meth-rock-candy-for-breaking-bad/\r\n3. http://www.gastronomiavegana.org/el-laboratorio/la-ciencia-del-caramelo/\r\n4. wikipedia for chemistry formulae\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing:\r\nPlease! do it! all my chemistry is from high school and wikipedia!\r\n\r\n## License \r\nThis recipe is under a MIT license.
